        "# 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "# - Interpreted Languages: The code is executed line by line by an interpreter, e.g., Python.\n",
        "# - Compiled Languages: The code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, e.g., C.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "# - Exception handling in Python involves using try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "# - The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It’s typically used for cleanup operations (e.g., closing files or releasing resources).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "# - Logging is used to track events or errors in a program. It’s useful for debugging and understanding program flow over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "# - The __del__ method is the destructor in Python. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "# - import imports the whole module, while from ... import imports specific items (e.g., functions, classes) from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "# - You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by catching a tuple of exceptions in one block.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "# - The with statement automatically handles the opening and closing of files, ensuring the file is closed even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "# - Multithreading: Multiple threads run in a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
        "# - Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "# - Provides a way to track events, debug code, and record useful information about the program’s execution for future analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "# - Python uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection, to handle memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "# - The basic steps are: use try to execute code, use except to catch exceptions, else for code that runs if no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "# - Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, ensures efficient resource usage, and improves program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "# - try block contains the code that might raise an exception, while except handles the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "# - Python’s garbage collection system automatically frees memory that is no longer in use, mainly using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "# - The else block runs if no exception was raised in the try block, typically used for code that depends on successful execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "# - The common logging levels are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "# - os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current process (available in Unix), while multiprocessing is a higher-level abstraction for creating processes in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "# - Closing a file ensures that all data is written to disk and frees the resources associated with the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "# - file.read() reads the entire file content, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "# - The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "# - The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "# - Challenges include cyclic references, managing large data in memory, and ensuring timely garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "# - You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword, followed by the exception class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "# - Multithreading is crucial in applications that require parallel tasks, such as handling I/O operations, improving responsiveness, and optimizing performance.\n"
